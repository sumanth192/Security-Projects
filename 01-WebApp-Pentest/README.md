## üì∏ Evidence of Key Findings

### 1. SQL Injection (Authentication Bypass)

By injecting the payload `' or 1=1--` into the email parameter of the login request, I was able to bypass authentication and gain access as the administrator.

### 2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

A malicious webpage was created and hosted on a local server. When visited by a logged-in victim, it automatically submitted a request that changed their username to "CSRF ATTACK".
