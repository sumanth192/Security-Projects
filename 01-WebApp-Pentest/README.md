## üéØ Key Findings

A total of **14 alerts** were identified, including **1 Critical** and **2 High-risk** vulnerabilities that were manually validated. The most significant findings are:

* **üíâ CRITICAL - SQL Injection:** Successfully bypassed the login mechanism to gain full administrator access to the application.
* **üé≠ HIGH - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Demonstrated the ability to forcefully change a user's account details without their knowledge or consent.
* **‚ú® HIGH - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Executed arbitrary JavaScript in a user's browser by crafting a malicious link.

## üì∏ Evidence of Key Findings

|1. |SQL Injection (Authentication Bypass)|By injecting the payload `' or 1=1--` into the email parameter of the login request, I was able to bypass authentication and gain access as the administrator.|
