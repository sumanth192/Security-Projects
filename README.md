# Security-Projects
Welcome to my portfolio of cybersecurity projects. This repository contains a collection of hands-on tasks I have completed to develop and demonstrate my practical skills in key areas of defensive and offensive security. Each project is self-contained and includes relevant code, reports, and documentation.
